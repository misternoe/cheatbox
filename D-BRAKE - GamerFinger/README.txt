IMPORTANT -- Printing Orientation
The D-BRAKE looks best when printed upright, with the mount parallel-ish to the build plate. Check the reference photo in the GitHub directory.

Infill: 10% to 25%

Layer height: 0.2 minimum

Build Plate Adhesion Type: Brim highly recommended due to the verticality of the printing orientation

Supports: Yes - Touching Buildplate

PRINTING SERVICES: SIZING WHEN UPLOADED

TBD


/////////////
INSTALLATION
/////////////
1. Remove plunger or keycap (see manufacturer for info on this if needed)
2. Mount D-BRAKE onto the button/microswitch

Note: if you notice that the D-BRAKE doesn't pop back up when released, you may need to trim down walls of the stem mount. Excess filament can accumulate in this area due to poor bridging and support material.
