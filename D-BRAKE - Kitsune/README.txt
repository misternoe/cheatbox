PRINTER SETTINGS
/////////////

IMPORTANT -- Printing Orientation
The D-BRAKE looks best when printed upright with a 20º - 30º tilt (D-BRAKE logo facing up) and using regular supports.

Infill: 20% minimum

Layer height: 0.2 minimum

Build Plate Adhesion Type: Brim highly recommended due to the verticality of the printing orientation

Supports: Yes - Touching Buildplate


/////////////
FINISHING (Completely optional or even unnecessary for higher-end printers)
/////////////
It is recommended to sand down this print to provide a smoother and more comfortable surface. Use a high grit wet sandpaper (600 or higher). Please remember to take proper safety precautions to avoid inhalation by yourself and others in your vicinity.
