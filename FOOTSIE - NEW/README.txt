THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE PRINTING
///////////////////////////////

All testing conducted on a Dremel DigiLab 3D45 with a stock 2023 Snackbox Micro One Piece Case, 2023 Artwork Case, and Original Artwork Case

Materials tested:
PLA: Excellent output

Important:
Make sure that your 3D printer is configured properly before printing this accessory. Due to the thin nature of this product, ensuring that the first few layers print cleanly will ensure a stronger end product.


/////////////
PRINTER SETTINGS
/////////////
20% infill or higher recommended

Layer height
0.34 minimum, 0.3 or lower recommended!

Printing orientation
Larger printers can print this flat. Smaller printers will have to rotate it 90 degrees. Please see reference image in this folder.

Build Plate Adhesion Type
Skirt highly recommended if printing either flat or at 90 degrees

Supports
Yes - Touching Buildplate if printing 90 degrees will work. Support everywhere can be a hassle to remove but may prevent warping of the thin baseplate. If printing flat, I do not know, my printer is too small to print this model flat.
