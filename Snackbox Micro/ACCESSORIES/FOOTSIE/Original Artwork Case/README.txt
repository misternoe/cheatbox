///////////////////////////////
THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE PRINTING
///////////////////////////////

All testing conducted on a Dremel DigiLab 3D45 with a stock pre-2023 Snackbox Micro Artwork Case.

Materials tested:
PLA: Excellent output

Important:
Make sure that your 3D printer is configured properly before printing this accessory. Due to the thin nature of this product, ensuring that the first few layers print cleanly will ensure a stronger end product.


/////////////
PRINTER SETTINGS
/////////////
15% Infill recommended

Layer height
0.3 or 0.34 look great and print quickly. 0.34 looks best to me personally.
