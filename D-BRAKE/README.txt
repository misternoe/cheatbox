THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE PRINTING
///////////////////////////////

All testing conducted on a Dremel DigiLab 3D45

Materials tested:
PLA: Excellent output


/////////////
PRINTER SETTINGS
/////////////

IMPORTANT -- Printing Orientation
The D-BRAKE looks best when printed upright, with the mount parallel to the build plate. Check the reference photo in the GitHub directory.

Infill: 10% recommended to keep the weight down

Layer height: 0.2 minimum

Build Plate Adhesion Type: Brim highly recommended due to the verticality of the printing orientation

Supports: Yes - Touching Buildplate


/////////////
FINISHING
/////////////
It is recommended to sand down this print to provide a smoother and more comfortable surface. Use a high grit wet sandpaper (600 or higher). Please remember to take proper safety precautions to avoid inhalation by yourself and others in your vicinity.
